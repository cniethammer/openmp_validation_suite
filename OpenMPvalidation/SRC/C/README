How to compile and run:

1. Modify Makefile to contain the proper names and flags for  your compiler
   CC is the C compiler, 
   CFLAGS are the flags for OpenMP and optimization

   The Makefile contains sample configs for most platforms. 

2. "make compile" will compile the suite for OpenMP version 1.
   "make run" will run the test

   Other targets:
    - "all" compiles all tests
    - "run" runs test for OpenMP v1.
    - "run2" runs test for OpenMP v2
    - "run4" runs test for scheduling clause )

3. How to add new test stuff to the C test suite:

  1. get the test: copy whateverfile.c to check_something.c
   "cp ../Simple/whateverfile.c check_something.c"
  2. rename main() function in check_something.c to 
   "int check_something()"
  3. add the declaration "int check_something();" to omp_testsuite.h"
  4. add a call to this test in main() in the file check_omp_main.c
  5. rewrite check_something():
    - it should return "1" if the test is successfull and "0" otherwise
    - no output should be created
  6. Add check_something.o in the list of OBJECTS in Makefile
