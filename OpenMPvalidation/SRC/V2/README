I.  INTRODUCTION
==============================================================================

I.1.  Aims and general function
--------------------------------

The OpenMP validation suite is designed to verify the correct implementation
of OpenMP in compilers. It is capable of checking Fortran as well as c
compiler.

Testing the implementation is based on statistics. Each directive is tested
by computing and verifying the result with the already known value. In most 
cases a wrong implementation can result in the right values. So the tests are
run several times.

Additional the validation suite creates so called crosstests for each 
directive. These are tests in which either the directive is missing or used
with different arguments. If this so called crosstest fails this indicates 
strongly, that the previous test is capable of testing the directive.

II.  USAGE                                                                  
==============================================================================


II.1. First run with make
--------------------------


You can do a thirst simple run of the testsuite only after one step of configuration:

1.) Modify the Makefile to your wishes using the CC/FC and CFLAGS/FFLAGS variables

And now you can run the testsuite either for a c compiler with

>	make ctest 

or for an fortran compiler with

>	make ftest


II.2. Where to search for results
---------------------------------


When running the testsuite the results will be shown on the screen.

If you need the results for further purpose you can use the results.txt. The 
results.txt files is a simple list containing the results for each directive
in a single line. Each line starts with the name of the directive. Then follows
the result of the test given in the percentage of the passed tests. If 100% of 
the tests passed successfull the second number gives the result of the 
corresponding crosstest. Otherwise there stands a "-".
After the results of the normal test there follow these of the tests in orphaned 
mode. If there were no orphaned tests available this is shown by a "-".

If you run the testsuite with different numbers of threads (e.g. using the 
runtest.pl script) the results are shown in blocks of 4 columns for each number
of threads.

If a test failes you can find more detailed information in the compile.log, 
*.out and *.log files.
While the compile.log file contains all compiler error messages for all tests the
*.out and *.log files contain detailed inforamtion on the execution process of the
single tests.
In the *.out files there are listed all the results of the single executions of 
the tests. In the *.log files there are error messages of the tests itself.


II.3. Using the runtest script
-------------------------------


So for special purpose you can use the runtest.pl script, which allows a lot 
more options for the execution process than the execution with make.

Using the runtest.pl script is rather easy. You can use the the test suite only
after two steps of modifications:
 
1.) Modify the Makefile to your wishes choosing your compiler and the necessary
    compiler flags.  
2.) If necessary edit one of the test lists and comment out the tests you do not
    want to run using # at the beginning of a line. Testlists for Fortran end 
    with -f.txt while test lists for c with -c.txt.

And now you can run the test suite either for Fortran using
	#	>  ./runtest.pl -lang=fortran -d=fortran testlist-f.txt
or for c
	#	>  ./runtest.pl -lang=c -d=c testlist-c.txt

With the --help option you can show the complete list of options and their
explanations.

The test results are summarized in results.txt while *.log keep details for 
individual tests. There is also a file (compile.log) keeping compilation 
information. (see section II.2 )

With the test suite there come three test lists: One containing all tests, one
with the tests for version 1.0 of OpenMP and one with the tests for version
2.0/2.5 of OpenMP. 

If you don't want to test the directives in orphaned mode you can use the
-norphan option. You also can use the runtest.pl script either to compile all
tests or run compiled tests e.g. for cross compilation on other platforms. For
this there are the options -norun and -nocompile.

Happy testing!

III.	How to add new tests / The structure of test templates
==============================================================================

III.1  The template structure
------------------------------

The test suite is based on templates so that you only have one file for test,
crosstest and the orphaned versions of them.

	A) Description of the template structure

The syntax of the templates is much like xml. So each test begins with
'<ompts:test>' and ends with '</ompts:test>'.

In between there are several other blocks holding information:

- <ompts:testdescription> </ompts:testdescription> In between this tag you can
  give a description on what the test checks and how it works.

- <ompts:ompversion> </ompts:version> This tag is used to specify the
  OpenMP-version which includes the tested directive.

- <ompts:directive> </ompts:directive> Used to specify the directive how it is
  called in the programming language.

- <ompts:dependences> </ompts:dependences> With this tag you can specify other
  omp directives which are necessary for the correct execution of your test.
The directives have to be listed by their directive names as it is called in
the programming language. Multiple directives are separated by ','.

- <ompts:testcode> </ompts:testcode> In this tag stands the whole source code
  for the test / crosstest.  Each test has to be written as a function. The
syntax of the functions differs between C and Fortran: In C it has to take a
file pointer 'FILE * logFile' and return an int. If the test has been passed
successful it has to return 0. The file pointer can be used to write
information into a log file.  In Fortran the function takes no argument and the
function name must not exceed XX characters.  The return value has to be
specified using the '<testfunctionname>' tags. It has to be 1 if the test
succeeded and 0 if the test failed. For details see the example.

To tell the test suite the name of your test function you have to enclose it
into the '<ompts:testcode:functionname> </ompts:testcode:functionname>' tag.

If there are differences between test and crosstest you can use the
<ompts:check> </ompts:check> and <ompts:crosscheck> </ompts:crosscheck> tag.
When generating the test the parser will use the code enclosed in
<ompts:check> tags and cut out the code written in <ompts:crosscheck> tags. So
you have two possibilities to write your template for test and crosstest: The
first way you can write the complete code is to write the test in one
<ompts:check> tag and later the crosstest in one <ompts:crosscheck> tag.  The
second way is to write both tests only by enclosing differing parts in
corresponding tags.

The first method should be preferred if test and crosstest differ much from
each other. The second e.g. if you only want to change a few options like
replacing an omp singleprivate clause by an omp private clause or to cut out
a directive like omp flush.  When you use the first way you have to take care
of the function name! You have to declare it twice with
<ompts:testcode:functionname>!

- <ompts:orphan> </ompts:orphan> This tag can be used if you want to enable
  your test to check the directive in orphan regions, too.  The code enclosed
in this part will be written to a separate function which will be called
instead.  If you have variables which are used outside this region you have to
declare them as global variables enclosed in an <ompts:orphan:vars> tag. For
further information see the description of the <ompts:orphan:vars> tag.

- <ompts:orphan:vars> </ompts:orphan:vars> This tag is used to specify global
  variables for an orphan region which allow the exchange of values between
the main program and the orphaned functions. The usage differs between C and
Fortran.  In C you have to use a single declaration for each variable. You can
either declare all variables in one single or in several different regions. You
must not initialize the variables inside!  In Fortran you have to put all
declarations in one single tag. Because there exist no global variables as in
C you have to use common blocks. For further information see the examples.

III.2.  Adding tests to the test lists
--------------------------------------

After you have created a new test you have to add them to a testlist. Simply 
add the function name in a new Line into a file.
