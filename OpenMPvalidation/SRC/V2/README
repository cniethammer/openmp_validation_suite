I.  INTRODUCTION
==============================================================================

I.1.  Aims and general function
--------------------------------

The OpenMP validation suite is designed to verify the correct implementation
of OpenMP in compilers. It is capable of checking fortran as well as c
compiler.

Testing the implementation is based on statistics. Each directive is tested
by computing and verifiing the result with the already known value. In most 
cases a wrong implementation can result in the right values. So the tests are
run several times.

Additional the validation suite creates so called crosstests for each 
directive. These are tests in which either the directive is missing or used
with different arguments. If this so called crosstest fails this indicates 
srongly, that the previous test is capable of testing the directive.

II.  USAGE                                                                  
==============================================================================


II.1. Using the runtest script.
-------------------------------


Using the runtest.pl script is rather easy. You can use the the testsuite only
after two steps of modifications:
 
1.) Modify the Makefile to your wishes coosing your comiler and the necessary
    compiler flags.  
2.) If necessary edit one of the testlists and outcomment the tests you do not
    want to run using # at the begin of a line. Testlists for fortran end with
    -f.txt testlists for c with -c.txt.

And now you can run the testsuite either for fortran using

	#	>  ./runtest.pl -lang=fortran -d=fortran testlist-f.txt
or for c
	#	>  ./runtest.pl -lang=c -d=c testlist-c.txt

The test results are summarized in results.txt while *.log keep details for 
individual tests. There is also a file (compile.log) keeping compilation 
information.

With the testsuite there come three testlists: One containing all tests, one
with the tests for version 1.0 of OpenMP and one with the tests for version
2.0/2.5 of OpenMP. 

If you dont't want to test the directives in orphaned mode you can use the
-norphan option. You also can use the runtest.pl script eather to compile all
tests or run compiled tests e.g. for cross compilation on other platforms. For
this there are the options -norun and -nocompile.

With the --help option you can show the complete list of options and their
explanations.

Happy testing!

III.	How to add new tests / The structure of testtemplates
==============================================================================

III.1  The template structure
------------------------------

The testsuite is based on templates so that you only have one file for test,
crosstest and the orphaned versions of them.

	A) Description of the template structure

The syntax of the templates is much like xml. So each test begins with
'<ompts:test>' and ends with '</ompts:test>'.

In between there are several other blocks holding information:

- <ompts:testdescription> </omtps:testdescription> Inbetween this tag you can
  give an description on what the test checks and how it works.

- <ompts:ompversion> </ompts:version> This tag is used to specify the
  OpenMP-version which includes the tested directive.

- <ompts:directive> </ompts:directive> Used to specify the directive how it is
  called in the programming language.

- <ompts:dependences> </ompts:dependences> With this tag you can specify other
  omp directives which are necessary for the correct execution of your test.
The directives have to be listed by their directive names as it is called in
the programming language. Multiple directives are seperated by ','.

- <ompts:testcode> </ompts:testcode> In this tag stands the whole sourcecode
  for the test / crosstest.  Each test has to be written as a function. The
syntax of the functions deffere between C and fortran: In C it has to take a
filepointer 'FILE * logFile' and return an int. If the test has been passed
succesfull it has to return 0. The filepointer can be used to write
information into a logfile.  In Fortran the function takes no argument and the
functionname must not exceed XX characters.  The return value has to be
specified using the '<testfunctionname>' tags. It has to be 1 if the test
succeded and 0 if the test failed. For details see the example.

To tell the testsuite the name of your testfunction you have to enclodse it
into the '<ompts:testcode:functionname> </ompts:testcode:functionname>' tag.

If there are differences between test and crosstest you can use the
<ompts:check> </ompts:check> and <ompts:crosscheck> </ompts:crosscheck> tag.
When generating the test the parser will use the code enclosed in
<onpts:check> tags and cut out the code written in <ompts:crosscheck> tags. So
you have two possibilities to write your template for test and crosstest: The
first way you can write the complete code is to write the test in one
<ompts:check> tag and later the crosstest in one <ompts:crosscheck> tag.  The
second way is to write both tests only by enclosing differing parts in
according tags.

The first method should be prefered if test and crosstest differ much from
each other. The second e.g. if you only want to change a few options like
replaceing an omp singleprivate clauase by an omp private clause or to cut out
an directive like omp flush.  When you use the first way you have to take care
of the functionname! You have to declare it twice with
<ompts:testcode:functionname>!

- <ompts:orpahn> </ompts:orphan> This tag can be used if you want to enable
  your test to check the directive in orphan regions, too.  The code enclosed
in this part will be written to an separate function which will be called
instead.  If you have variables which are used outside this region you have to
declare them as global variables enclosed in an <ompts:orphan:vars> tag. For
further information see the description of the <omps:orpahn:vars> tag.

- <ompts:orphan:vars> </ompts:orphan:vars> This tag is used to specify global
  variables for an orphan region which allow the exchange of values between
the mainprogram and the orphaned functions. The usage differes between C and
fortran.  In C you have to use a single declaration for each variable. You can
either decalar all variables in one single or in several differnt regions. You
must not initialise the variables inside!  In fortran you have to put all
declarations in one singel tag. Because there exist no global variables as in
C you have to use common blocks. For further information see the examples.

III.2.  Adding tests to the testlists
--------------------------------------

After you have created a new test you have to add them to a testlist. Simply 
add the functionname in a new Line into a file.
