Special issue for Fotran:
	shorter prefix chk_ crschk_ are used.
  	the maximum length of fortran test names is limited to 24, since
	the prefix 'crschk_'  will add 7 more characters to the final function name

Requirements:
	gmake
	bash

Basic usage
   gmake clean
   gmake run

Flexible usage:
	gmake clean
	gmake run testfile=OMP1_TEST | OMP2_TEST | CUSTOME_TEST
 	gmake run will use OMP1_TEST by default 

	CUSTOME_TEST can be changed with any test names from ALL_TEST.

Changes.
	separated files for each test
	preCompilation script to test compilation phase
	Predefined test function sets and user defined set
	One main.f  for any test cases
	main.f uses two auto-generated files
